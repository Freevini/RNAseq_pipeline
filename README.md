# RNAseq_pipeline

This is an analysis pipeline for RNA-Seq data of both prokaryotic aswell as eucaryotic.
However the pipeline was tested with and built for prokaryotic organisms.
Additionally it is designed mainly for organisms with a good reference genome which is well annotated.
The pipeline is ment for Illumina short reads and works with both PE and SR data and works best on non-single cell data.

The file start with raw fastq.gz reads.
Thereforth it does all the data processing including pseudomapping.
Further it does the differential expression analysis in r using edgeR.
All diagnostic plots for the preprocessing are illustrated in the multiqc.
All diagnostic plots for the Differential expression are in the plots directory.

### Visualizing results with `iResViewer`

The output file of the workflow (`output/shiny_results.rds`) can be directly used as input to the [`iResViewer`](https://github.com/csoneson/iResViewer) package in order to generate a shiny application where the results can be viewed. After installing `iResViewer`, make sure that the bigWig files listed in the `bwFiles` slot of `output/shiny_results.rds` are reachable (they will be streamed into the shiny application for coverage visualizations). The following code will start a shiny application where you can browse the results:

```
library(iResViewer)
res <- readRDS("output/shiny_results.rds")
do.call(iResViewer, res)
```

The title of the shiny application can also be specified:

```
do.call(iResViewer, c(res, list(appTitle = "myTitle")))
```

##Running the workflow

### Preparation
To use the RNA-seq workflow on your own data, you need to first follow the steps below:

##### Input files

- Put the gzipped fastq files in the `FASTQ` directory. The `Makefile` assumes that these files are named according to the pattern `<sample-name>.fastq.gz` (or `<sample-name>_R1.fastq.gz` and `<sample-name>_R2.fastq.gz` for paired-end data), if this is not the case you need to rename the files or modify the `Makefile` accordingly.
-  Create a tab-separated metadata text file. This file should have at least one column, named `ID`, which contains all the values of `<sample-name>` from the fastq files. In addition, any number of columns can be included and used later in the analysis. 

##### Include paths to input files in the `Makefile`

(Basically, this and the next step aims to fill all the lines of the type `variable := ` in the `Makefile`)

- Include the path to the metadata file in the `Makefile` at the requested line (`metatxt := `).
- Add paths to reference files in the `Makefile`. Note that you will also have to add desired paths for indexes etc that will be generated by the workflow. The following reference files are used in the workflow, and can be downloaded from [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html) (note that the workflow assumes that the reference files are in Ensembl format):
	- Genome fasta file
	- Corresponding GTF file
	- cDNA fasta file
	- ncRNA fasta file
-  Add the list of `<sample-name>` to either the `PEsamples` or `SEsamples` variable in the `Makefile`, depending on whether you have paired-end or single-end data. Leave the other variable empty (but don't remove it).
-  Add the readlength for your RNA-seq reads to the `Makefile`.
-  Add a "group variable" to the `Makefile`. This will be used to color the samples in downstream visualizations.
-  Set the number of cores to use for the tools that support multi-threading.

##### Include paths to software in the `Makefile`

- Make sure that all necessary software is installed, and modify the first section of the `Makefile` to add paths to the software binaries. The following software is used by the workflow:
	- [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
	- [Salmon](https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/)
	- [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
	- [TrimGalore!](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/)
	- [Cutadapt](http://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html)
	- [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR)
	- [samtools](http://www.htslib.org/)
	- [MultiQC](http://multiqc.info/)
	- [bedtools](http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
	- bedGraphToBigWig (select your operating system from [this page](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/) and download the executable)
- Make sure that all necessary R packages are installed. The workflow uses the following packages:
	- [Biostrings](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biostrings.html)
	- [tximport](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tximport.html)
	- [limma](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html)
	- [edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html)
	- [reshape2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html)
	- [tibble](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tibble/index.html)
	- [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html)
	- [tidyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/index.html)
	- [rtracklayer](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rtracklayer.html)

##### Set up the correct differential expression analysis
- The `scripts/run_dge_edgeR.R` script contains the basic code to perform differential expression analysis with [edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html). However, you need to modify it in order to perform the proper analysis for your data. As a minimum, define the design and the contrast(s) you would like to use. If you make additional modifications, make sure that the output of the script follows the requirements outlined in `scripts/run_dge_edgeR.R`. 

### Running the workflow

If all the instructions above have been followed, the workflow can be run from the command line by simply typing 

```make```

This will generate all necessary output directories and run the analysis for the indicated samples. 

### Checking software versions

The workflow contains two rules to check the versions of the software that has been used. To check the versions of R packages, running `make listpackages` will parse the output files generated by `R CMD BATCH` and extract all used R packages. The results will be written to a text file. To check the versions of other software, running `make softwareversions` will check the versions of the software defined by the variables in the `Makefile`. Note, however, that if any alias has been modified since the analysis was run, the rule will print the current version instead of the one used for the analysis.
